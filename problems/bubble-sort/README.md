# bubble-sort

This time around I got no fancy story about a 
neighbour or a person in need of help.
Your task is to implement the bubble sort
algorithm in cpp in whatever way you see fit.

In the headers directory you will find a hpp
file, include it and use the generateRandomNumbers
function inside the custom namespace to generate an
n amount of random numbers.

Example:
```cpp
    custom::generateRandomNumbers(100); 
```

This problem comes with a possible flowchart
implementation of bubble sort.

Good luck!
