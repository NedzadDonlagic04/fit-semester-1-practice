# senads-time-of-day

Senad, otherwise known as Seno amongst the people
of his home town of "The Island" is the holder for
the world record for the oldest man alive at the
age of 151, he has achieved this due to the many 
many years of training and care he put into his body. 

Recently tho age has started catching up to Seno 
and he has had issues telling what part of the day 
it is, and as his closest neighbour it's your job
to help him.

You are tasked with making a program that will take
the current time of day and display what period of
the day it is, taking into consideration where he
lives, the given input should give the following
output (for the sake of simplicity the output will
just be a string):

(Current Time In Hours) =   (Given Output)

         6 -  9         =   Early Morning
        10 - 11         =   Late Morning
        12 - 13         =   Early Afternoon
        14 - 16         =   Afternoon
        17 - 19         =   Evening
        20 - 22         =   Late Evening 
        23 -  5         =   Night Time
