Fahra runs an old bakery down the street you live in.
One time you went there she mentioned hearing about
your achievements in the world of programming and has
asked you to make her a program to calculate and display
the amount of money she'd accumulate for a given week.
(Yes the bakery works every day).

Fahra would give you a starting amount of money and the 
average she'd receive at the end of each day.

Your task is to create a program that achieves this in whatever
way you see fit, you may use anything from the standard library,
your only restrictions would be making sure the numbers entered
would never be negative or 0 (so natural numbers only) and that
they never exceed a certain amount of your choosing.

I.E. the amount of starting money probably isn't 100 000 
and the average per day isn't 10 000 considering it's an old 
bakery down the street.

With this problem an example flowchart for a possible solution
does exist.
