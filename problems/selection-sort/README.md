# selection-sort

The popular social media platform Y owned by the billionaire Melon Usk
has recently hired you, a fresh college graduate, as one of their
software engineers.

One of the features of Y is sorting posts from most popular (most likes)
and from least popular (least likes). Your job is to show an implementation
of sorting a random set of posts in ASCENDING or DESCENDING order using the
selection sort algorithm. Why selection sort? Because your boss said so.
