# convert-to-binary

Given an input of a number and a bit count, convert the given number
based on 3 categories:
- just the signed bit
- 1s complement
- 2s complement

Examples:
So let's say the user enters 5 bits and to convert the number 10
Just the signed bit:    10101 
1s complement:          10101
2s complement:          10110

Let's say the user enters 5 bits and to convert the number 4
Just the signed bit:    00100 
1s complement:          11011 
2s complement:          11100 

And of course good luck and have fun
