# fit-semester-1-practice

In this repository will be a collection of practice
problems made by students who plan to attend the FIT
college.

Folders inside this directory will have a name that
associates itself with a given problem inside of it.

Inside those folders is a README describing the problem 
and maybe an img folder to store the flowchart as a 
helper in solving the problem.

The generator.py file contains a python script that
can be used to generate some boilerplate for creating
problems, example usage via command line:

> python3 generator.py example_problem_name

Thanks to anyone willing to contribute and good luck
practicing!
