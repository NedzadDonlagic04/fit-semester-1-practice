# fit-semester-1-practice

In this repository will be a collection of practice
problems made by students who plan to attend the FIT
college.

Folders inside this directory will have a name that
associates itself with a given problem inside of it.

Inside those folders is usually a README describing
the problem and maybe an img folder to store the
flowchart as a helper in solving the problem.

When adding a solution to a problem it is mandatory
that the cpp file has your username at the top of the
file commented. The file will be removed in case it
does not properly solve the given problem.

Thanks to anyone willing to contribute and good luck
practicing!
